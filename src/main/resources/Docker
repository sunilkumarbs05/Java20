Docker

Docker: Docker is a tool that allows developers, sys-admins etc. to easily deploy their applications in a sandbox (called containers) to run on the host operating system i.e. Linux.

	It allows users to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardised unit for software development.

Image:- A Docker image is a file which has set of instructions to build a Docker container, like a template
Container: it’s a running version of image

A Dockerfile must be created with no extension.
