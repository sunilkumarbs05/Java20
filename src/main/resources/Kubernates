Kubernetes

What is Kubernetes?
- Container management(Orchestration) Tool
- Developed by google Lab (& later donated to CNCF)
- Open source
- Written in Golang
- Also called K8s

What is Container management / Orchestration Tool
	Container management tool or engine automated deploying, scaling and managing containerised application on a group of server.
	That are : Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos Marathon

What is Docker
	Docker is a tool which allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies and ship it all out as one package.

	Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to deploy and run application by using container

Container management tool manages
        1. Deploying
        2. scheduling
        3. scaling
        4. Load balancing
        5. Batch execution
        6. Roll backs
        7. Monitoring

What are the features of Kubernetes ?
    1. Automatic bin package
    2. Service discovery and load balancing
    3. Storage orchestration
    4. Self healing
    5. Automated rollout and rollback
    6. Batch execution
    7. Horizantal Scaling
    8.  Secret and Configuration management

Pod
    - An application container
    - A unique network IP
    - Storage resource

Node
    - Physical machine
    - Virtual machine
    - VM on cloud

Secrets and Config map
- Secrets ->It is a kubernets object that separa  sensitive  data like passwords, keys and token from pods and container. Created outside pods and containers.
- Config map -> It is a kubernets object that configuration from pods and container. Created outside pods and containers.
- Secrets and config are stored in ETCD database(Key and value store, size 1MB)

Cluster, Master node and  worker node
	Master Node
        - Responsible for managing cluster
        - Monitor nodes and pods in cluster
        - When node fails, move the workload of the failed node to another worker node.

Basic Architecture
	4 Components of master node
	3 Components of worker node
	Addons
	How master and worker node interact

	Master node components
    - API server —> for all communication (Json over HTTP API)
    - Scheduler —> schedule pods on nodes
    - Controller manager —> runs controller
    - Etcd —> open source, key and value distributed distributed database from coreOS
